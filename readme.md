# Compliment Bot

Comes with 69 pre-loaded compliments! :clap:

## Setup

* Clone or download the repository and rename `config.json.example` to `config.json`.
* Open `config.json` in your favorite text editor and edit to your liking.
* Run the bot by opening a terminal (for windows it's called command prompt), navigate to the bot's directory using the `cd` command 
	* If you don't know how to use the `cd` command please follow this guide.
* Once you have navigated to the bot's directory you can start the bot by running `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt` then `python3 bot.py`

I'll make a step by step tutorial on how to add your own compliments at a later date.

Happy complimenting! :sparkles:
