# Compliment Bot

Comes with 69 pre-loaded compliments! :clap:

## Setup

This section will tell you how to properly run the bot.

### Requirements

* Python 3.8 or higher

### Instructions

* Clone or download the repository and rename `config.json.example` to `config.json`.
* Open `config.json` in your favorite text editor and edit to your liking.
* Run the bot by opening a terminal (for windows it's called command prompt), navigate to the bot's directory using the `cd` command 
	* If you don't know how to use the `cd` command please follow [this guide](https://www.howtoforge.com/linux-cd-command/), for windows please follow [this guide instead](https://www.minitool.com/news/how-to-change-directory-in-cmd.html).
* Once you have navigated to the bot's directory you can start the bot by running `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt` then `python3 bot.py`

I'll make a step by step tutorial on how to add your own compliments at a later date. If you know python or know how to edit lists, the compliments are located in `cogs/compliments.py`, by all means add your own or customize this bot however you want!

Happy complimenting! :sparkles:
